# Bow Wood Guide

This guide is intended to help bowyer's find trees suitable for making bows. It is incomplete and possibly with error, please help by submitting pull requests to this repository or emailing me hunter @ hmiller.dev to make edits or corrections.

The images are currently pulled from Google searches. I intend to replace these images with my own as I collect them or from others who offer them for use here.

Below are links to various regions' guides:

Specific gravity numbers are all from [this post](https://forum.gon.com/threads/list-of-potential-bow-woods.481711/) which seems to pull most of its numbers from the Traditional Bowyer's Bible Vol. 4.
